## Methodology

### Problem Formulation

Given a 48-hour observation window of clinical measurements, predict whether a patient will develop sepsis within the next 6 hours. This is framed as a binary classification problem with severe class imbalance.

### Feature Engineering Rationale

**Tier 1: Critical Vital Signs** (7 features, 2-21% missing)
- Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Temperature, Respiratory Rate, SpO2

**Tier 2: Important Laboratory Values** (9 features, 14-28% missing)
- Lactate, Creatinine, Glucose, Potassium, WBC, Platelets, etc.

**Tier 3: Advanced Indicators** (1 feature, 27% missing)
- Bilirubin (liver function marker)

**Tier 4: Demographics** (3 features, 0% missing)
- Age, Gender, ICU Type

**Tier 5: Engineered Features** (27 features, 0% missing)
- SIRS criteria components
- Vital sign stability metrics
- Clinical thresholds and abnormality flags

**Temporal Features** (36 additional features)
- 6-hour rolling statistics (mean, std)
- Rate of change and percent change
- 3-hour trend analysis
- Clinical risk scores

### Training Strategy

1. **Class Imbalance Handling**:
   - SMOTE synthetic oversampling (13.51:1 → 4:1 ratio)
   - Focal loss (reduces easy example weight)
   - Proximity-based sample weighting (emphasizes pre-sepsis windows)

2. **Regularization**:
   - L1-L2 weight regularization
   - Dropout (0.1-0.4 depending on layer)
   - Batch Normalization after each layer
   - Gradient clipping (norm=1.0)

3. **Optimization**:
   - Adam optimizer with cyclical learning rate
   - Cosine annealing with warm restarts
   - Early stopping (patience=30, monitor val_f1)
   - Model checkpointing (save best weights)

## Evaluation

### Clinical Performance Metrics

Beyond standard ML metrics, the model is evaluated on:

- **Clinical Utility Score**: Balances sensitivity vs. false alarm burden
- **Time-to-Detection**: Average lead time before sepsis onset
- **Alert Precision**: Percentage of alerts that are true positives
- **Detection Rate**: Percentage of sepsis cases caught within window

### Statistical Testing

- Bootstrap confidence intervals (1000 iterations)
- Statistical significance testing (p-value < 0.05)
- Ablation studies to quantify component contributions
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimates
