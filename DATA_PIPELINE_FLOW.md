**Input:** Raw `healthcare_data` (44 features, 63% missing)
**Output:** `X_data`, `y_data`, `existing_features` (47 features, 6% missing)

#### **3.1: Feature Engineering (Temporal)**
Added 27 engineered features from vital signs:
```python
For each vital sign (HR, SBP, Temp, Resp, O2Sat, MAP):
  - {feature}_rolling_mean_6h   # 6-hour trends
  - {feature}_rolling_std_6h    # Variability
  - {feature}_diff              # Rate of change
  - {feature}_trend             # 3-hour trend direction
  
Additional:
  - cardiovascular_risk (MAP-based scoring)
  - respiratory_risk (O2Sat-based scoring)
  - shock_index (HR/SBP ratio)
```

#### **3.2: Intelligent Feature Selection (5-Tier System)**
**Tier 1 - Essential Vitals (7 features):** Always include
- HR, O2Sat, Temp, SBP, MAP, DBP, Resp
- Average missingness: 2-21% (EXCELLENT)

**Tier 2 - Important Labs (9 features):** Include if <50% missing
- Glucose, Potassium, Creatinine, BUN, Hct, Hgb, WBC, Platelets, Calcium
- Average missingness: 14-28% (GOOD)

**Tier 3 - Advanced Labs (1 feature):** Include if <30% missing
- Magnesium (27.9% missing)
- EXCLUDED: Lactate, pH, PaCO2 (>50% missing)

**Tier 4 - Demographics (3 features):** Always include
- Age, Gender, ICULOS
- 0% missing (PERFECT)

**Tier 5 - Engineered (27 features):** Always include
- All temporal features created in 3.1
- 0% missing (we create them)

**Final Selection:** 47 high-quality features, 6% average missingness

#### **3.3: Advanced Imputation**
**Strategy:** Two-stage imputation
1. Temporal forward-fill (within patient groups)
2. Median imputation (remaining gaps)

**Results:**
```
Missing before: 4,361,627 values
Missing after:  0 values
Success rate:   100% ✅
```

---

### **Section 4: Optimized Sequential Windowing** ✅
**Input:** `healthcare_data` (1.5M records, 47 features)
**Output:** `X_windows`, `y_windows`, `sample_weights`

#### **Windowing Strategy:**
```python
Window size: 48 hours (captures sepsis onset patterns)
Step size:   6 hours (overlapping for more training data)
Min stay:    48 hours required
```

#### **Proximity Weighting:**
```python
For each window:
  If contains sepsis:
    weight = 5.0 + (3.0 × sepsis_density)
    # Results in 5-8x weighting
  Else:
    weight = 1.0
```

**Output Statistics:**
```
Windows created:     28,393
From patients:       9,538 (out of 40,336)
Window shape:        (28,393, 48, 47)
                     └─────┘  └┘  └┘
                     samples  time features

Sepsis windows:      1,956 (6.89%)
Non-sepsis windows:  26,437 (93.11%)
Average weight:      5.34x for sepsis, 1.0x for non-sepsis
```

---

### **Section 5: Data Splitting and Scaling** ✅
**Input:** `X_windows` (28,393, 48, 47)
**Output:** Train/test sets with robust scaling

#### **Split Configuration:**
```python
Train size: 80% = 22,714 windows
Test size:  20% = 5,679 windows
Strategy:   Stratified (preserves 6.89% sepsis ratio)
```

#### **Class Distribution:**
```
Training:   21,149 non-sepsis, 1,565 sepsis (13.5:1 ratio)
Test:       5,288 non-sepsis, 391 sepsis (13.5:1 ratio)
```

#### **Scaling Strategy:**
```python
Scaler: RobustScaler()
Reason: Better handles outliers vs StandardScaler
Range:  [-53.93, 78.13] after scaling
```

#### **Class Weighting (Baseline Models):**
```python
Balanced weights: {0: 0.537, 1: 7.257}
Applied weights:  {0: 1.0, 1: 14.5}  # 2x boost, capped at 20:1
Rationale: Aggressive but stable for extreme imbalance
```

**Final Data Quality:**
```
✅ No NaN values
✅ No Inf values
✅ Finite range
✅ Proper stratification
✅ Ready for training
```

   - 3 LSTM layers (128→64→32)
   - BatchNorm + Dropout (0.3-0.4)
   - Focal loss (alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0)

2. **GRU Model** (120K parameters)
   - 3 GRU layers (128→64→32)
   - BatchNorm + Dropout (0.3-0.4)
   - Focal loss (alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0)

3. **Hybrid LSTM-GRU** (331K parameters)

Batch size:   32
Epochs:       80 (with early stopping patience=20)
Callbacks:    EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint
```

#### **8: Evaluation Results (F1-Optimized)**
**F1-Score Optimization Strategy:**
- Test 90 thresholds (0.05-0.95)
- Optimize for F1-score (not accuracy)
- Medical context: Recall > Precision

**Final Performance:**
```
Model              F1-Score  Recall   Precision  AUC-ROC  Threshold
─────────────────  ────────  ───────  ─────────  ───────  ─────────
GRU (BEST)         0.2260    47.3%    14.9%      0.7167   0.650
Hybrid LSTM-GRU    0.1946    66.2%    11.4%      0.6803   0.570
LSTM               0.1881    69.8%    10.9%      0.6671   0.580
```

**Clinical Metrics (GRU - Best Model):**
```
True Positives:  185 / 391 sepsis cases detected (47.3%)
False Negatives: 206 / 391 sepsis cases missed (52.7%)
False Positives: 1,061 false alarms
Specificity:     79.9% (non-sepsis correctly identified)
```

**Assessment:**
- ⚠️ MODERATE performance with 47 baseline features
- Models detect sepsis but struggle with precision
- F1 ~0.20-0.23 establishes baseline for improvement

**Output:** 83 enhanced features (+36 new)

**New Features Added:**
```python
For 6 key vitals (HR, SBP, Temp, Resp, O2Sat, MAP):
  - {vital}_rolling_mean_6h    # Temporal trends
  - {vital}_rolling_std_6h     # Variability
  - {vital}_diff               # Rate of change
  - {vital}_pct_change         # Percentage change
  - {vital}_trend              # 3-hour rolling trend

Risk Scores:
  - cardiovascular_risk (0-2 scale based on MAP)
  - respiratory_risk (0-2 scale based on O2Sat)
  - shock_index (HR/SBP ratio)

Temporal Markers:
  - icu_day (day number in ICU)
  - hour_of_day (circadian patterns)
  - is_night (1 if hour 22-6, else 0)
```

**Result:** 47 → 83 features (+77% increase)

---

#### **9.2: Optimized Windowing with Proximity Weighting** ✅
**Input:** 83 enhanced features
**Output:** `X_windows_opt`, `y_windows_opt`, `sample_weights`

**Enhanced Weighting Strategy:**
```python
For each window:
  sepsis_density = count(sepsis in window) / window_size
  
  If contains sepsis:
    base_weight = 5.0 + (3.0 × sepsis_density)  # 5-8x
    
    # Extra weight for pre-onset windows (early detection)
    if window_label == 0 AND sepsis_onset_within_6h:
      base_weight *= 2.0  # Total 10-16x
  
  Else:
    base_weight = 1.0
```

**Output Statistics:**
```
Windows created:     28,393 (same as Section 4)
Window shape:        (28,393, 48, 83)  # ← 83 features now!
                     └─────┘  └┘  └┘
                     samples  time enhanced_features

Sepsis windows:      1,956 (6.89%)
Average weight:      5.34x for sepsis windows
Pre-onset boost:     Up to 16x for critical windows
```

---

#### **9.3: Advanced Hybrid Model Training** 🔧 FIXED

**9.3.1: Data Preparation** ✅
**Input:** `X_windows_opt` (28,393, 48, 83)
**Output:** Scaled train/test splits

```python
Split: 80/20 stratified
  Training: (22,714, 48, 83)
  Test:     (5,679, 48, 83)

Scaler: RobustScaler (outlier-robust)

Class weights: {0: 0.5, 1: 10.0}  # Capped at 10:1
  Natural ratio: 13.51:1
  Applied ratio: 20.0:1 (moderate boost)

Validation:
  ✅ No NaN values
  ✅ No Inf values
  ✅ All 83 features present
```

---

**9.3.2: Model Architecture** (502K parameters)
```
Advanced Hybrid Model:
├─ Multi-head Attention (8 heads, 64-dim)
├─ LSTM Branch: 128→64 units
├─ GRU Branch: 128→64 units
├─ LayerNormalization + Residual
├─ Final Attention (4 heads)
├─ GlobalAveragePooling1D
└─ Dense: 128→64→32→1 (with BatchNorm, Dropout)
```

**9.3.3: Training Configuration** 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED**

**BEFORE (Failed Training):**
```python
❌ Loss: focal_loss(alpha=0.75, gamma=2.0)  # Too aggressive
❌ Learning rate: 0.0001                     # Too low
❌ Class weight: {0: 1.0, 1: 20.0}          # Double penalization!
❌ Result: val_f1 = 0.0179 at Epoch 1, then 0.0000 forever
```

**AFTER (Fixed Training):**
```python
✅ Loss: focal_loss(alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0)  # Moderate emphasis
✅ Learning rate: 0.0003                     # Better convergence
✅ Sample weight: proximity weights only     # No double penalization
✅ Batch size: 32                            # Stable gradients
✅ Epochs: 80 with early stopping (patience=25)
```

**Why These Fixes Work:**
1. **Lower focal loss alpha (0.75→0.25):**
   - Reduces extreme minority class weighting
   - Prevents model from predicting everything as sepsis

2. **Higher learning rate (0.0001→0.0003):**
   - Helps escape poor local minimum from Epoch 1
   - Enables meaningful parameter updates

3. **Removed class_weight parameter:**
   - Focal loss ALREADY handles class imbalance
   - Using both = double penalization = extreme gradients
   - Now using only proximity-based sample weights (5.34x)

4. **Moderate epochs (80):**
   - Sufficient for convergence with early stopping
   - Prevents unnecessary computation

---

**9.3.4: Expected Training Behavior** 🎯

**During Training, You Should See:**
```
Epoch 1/80:  loss: 0.15-0.20, val_f1: 0.02-0.05
Epoch 5/80:  loss: 0.12-0.18, val_f1: 0.05-0.10
Epoch 10/80: loss: 0.10-0.15, val_f1: 0.08-0.15
Epoch 20/80: loss: 0.08-0.12, val_f1: 0.15-0.25
Epoch 30/80: loss: 0.06-0.10, val_f1: 0.20-0.35
Early Stop:  Epoch 30-50 typically
```

**✅ Good Signs:**
- val_f1_score_metric INCREASES gradually
- Loss stays finite (0.05-0.25 range)
- Training runs 20-40 epochs before stopping
- Final val_f1 > 0.25 (improvement over baseline 0.226)

**❌ Red Flags (Stop if you see):**
- NaN loss appears
- val_f1 stuck at 0.0000 for >5 epochs
- Training stops at Epoch 1-5
- Loss explodes (>1.0)

## 🚀 What To Do Now

### **Option 1: Re-run Section 9.3 (Recommended)**

Since fixes are applied, just execute the training cell:

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "### 9.3 Advanced Model Training" cell
2. Click "Run Cell" (Shift+Enter)
3. Monitor training progress (30-60 minutes)
4. Check for increasing val_f1_score_metric
5. Execute evaluation cell after training completes

**Expected Duration:**
- Training: 30-60 minutes (GPU)
- Evaluation: 5-10 minutes
- Total: 35-70 minutes

---

### **Option 2: Quick Validation Run**

Test with reduced epochs first:

```python
# In training cell, temporarily change:
epochs=80  →  epochs=20  # Quick test

# Then run full training if validation succeeds
```

---

### **Option 3: Review Data Quality First**

Check your data is ready:

```python
# Run this to verify everything is in place:
print("✅ Checklist:")
print(f"  X_windows_opt shape: {X_windows_opt.shape if 'X_windows_opt' in locals() else 'NOT FOUND'}")
print(f"  y_windows_opt shape: {y_windows_opt.shape if 'y_windows_opt' in locals() else 'NOT FOUND'}")
print(f"  Sample weights: {len(sample_weights) if 'sample_weights' in locals() else 'NOT FOUND'}")
print(f"  Features: {len(enhanced_features) if 'enhanced_features' in locals() else 'NOT FOUND'}")
```

All should show proper shapes. If NOT FOUND, re-run Sections 9.1-9.2.

---

## 📊 Key Metrics to Watch

**During Training:**
- `loss`: Should decrease from ~0.15 to ~0.08
